If you hold some BTS tokens, you are considered a BTS Holder of the
BitShares business and thus have a say in where it should be heading in
future. As a BTS Holder you can cast a vote for three different entities
within the network:

Block producers

:   Block producers bundle transactions into blocks and sign them with
    their signing key. These so called *witnesses* keep the blockchain
    alive by producing one block every few seconds and get paid by newly
    issued BTS shares similar to Bitcoin. Their second job is to produce
    reliable and accurate price feeds for the smartcoins.

Committee Members

:   Committee Members
    `govern the blockchain and the business parameters <blockchain-governance>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, and define the transaction fees.

Workers

:   Workers are freelancers or businesses that provide a non-profitable
    service for the BitShares ecosystem. Essentially, they apply for a
    job in the ecosystem by providing actual work and get paid
    accordingly (if the BTS Holders approve).

Since voting might be a too time-consuming task for many BTS Holders,
BitShares offers them a way to committee their voting power to so called
**proxies**. The sole purpose of proxies is to follow the ecosystem and
be vote according to their *followers*. This is similar to many
political votes where citizens vote for representatives which vote on
their behalf.

Voting itself is **very simple** with the User interface and requires
only a few clicks.
