# Graphene

## Welcome to the Graphene Documentation

The developers of BitShares formed Cryptonomex to monetize the
technology, experience, reputation and good will they accumulated during
their first two years of development and operations. Much of that
technology is embodied in Grapheneâ„¢, an industrial strength software
platform for deploying third generation cryptographically secure
decentralized ledgers known as block chains.

Graphene based systems have orders of magnitude better performance than
first-generation Bitcoin-derived systems or even the second generation
\"Bitcoin 2.0\" systems that constitute our current closest competitors.
Graphene based systems go beyond mere \"checkbook\" style payments to
offer a broad range of financial services distinguished by their
transparency and inherent incorruptibility.

This page documents the
[Graphene](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene) technology built by
[Cryptonomex](http://cryptonomex.com). You can see Graphene as a toolkit
for real-time blockchains. We separated the documentation into smaller
parts for convenience and for the sake of easy location of relevant
information.

### Blockchain Specific Guides

The Graphene Technology has been applied to several blockchain already.
BitShares 2.0 has been the first application of Graphene technology and
you will be able to find almost everything feature implemented in
BitShares 2.0. Further blockchains will be added independently.

[BitShares 2.0](http://BitShares.org) is a Financial Smart Contracts
platform that enables trading of digital assets and has market-pegged
assets that track the value of their underlying asset (e.g. bitUSD
tracking the U.S. dollar).
